""" ### Task hw1.1
Write a recursive function `is_palindrome` that checks if the given string
containing a single word is palindrome (for example, "racecar"). Do this using
TFD for recursive functions, write out all steps.
"""

""" TFD Steps
1. Inputs
2. Outputs
3. Special Cases
4. Usual Cases
5. Function Specification
6. Implement Test Cases
7. Implement the Function
8. Add/improve/fix test cases and function as needed
