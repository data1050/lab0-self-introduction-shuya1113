Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi my name is Shuya Zhang and currently a first year student in Data Science. I was born and grew up in China. After studying two years in a Chinese college, I  transferred to the University of Notre Dame and graduated this May. When I am not too busy, I cook a lot and learned cooking from Youtube. Thank you Youtube! I am currently staying in Michigan and studying online. Looking forward to moving to Providence sometime!
